[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mmore  [22mis  a  filter  for paging through text one screenful at a time.  This version is especially primitive.  Users should realize

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       Options are also taken from the environment variable [1mMORE [22m(make sure to precede them with a dash  ([1m-[22m))  but  command-line  options
       will override those.

              ically if the executable is named [1mpage[22m.

       [1m-c     [22mDo not scroll.  Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing the remainder of each line as it is displayed.
